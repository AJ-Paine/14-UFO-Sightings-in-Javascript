# UFO Sightings in Javascript
Javascript, HTML, and CSS were used in two parts while rendering data on UFO sightings from January 2010 to a webpage.
## LEVEL 1
Wrote javascript code that appeneds a table to html webpage and then adds table data of ufo sighting data each row of the table.  This data can then be filtered by date by using a click and submit event listener in javascript.
## LEVEL 2
Building off of the Level 1 part of the project, I added functionality to be able to filter the UFO sightings by city, state, country and shape.
